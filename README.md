# Hand-Gesture-PC-Control
This project is designed under Human Computer Interaction(HCI) domain. In this application we have proposed a method for real time tracking of hand gesture. The gestures are recorded using webcam. The main aim of this project is to create a natural interaction between human and computers in which recognized hand gestures can be used for performing some predefined system operations. This project uses cascade classifier for detecting hand from camera. After hand detection, the centroid is calculated then the motion of hand. If the motion of hand is matched with stored gesture, then the corresponding action is performed.
